```{r}
knitractive::start("bash",
                   prompt = tmuxr::prompts$bash,
                   docker_image = "ubuntu:bionic",
                   session_width = 100,
                   session_height = 16)
```

```{bash, include = FALSE}
PS1='$ '
```

```{bash}
top #! enter = FALSE
```

Normally, the screen "scrolls" after the output has been captured. This can be prevented by specifying the chunk option `scroll = FALSE`, which is especially useful for making multiple captures of fullscreen interfaces like `top`.

```{bash, literal = FALSE, scroll = FALSE}
Enter #! hold = 1
```

Scrolling is needed only after the last capture, so with the next chunk, we don't specify `scroll = FALSE`.

```{bash, literal = FALSE}
#! wait = 1
```

```{bash, keep_last_prompt = TRUE, fullscreen = TRUE}
C-c #! literal = FALSE
seq 10
```

```{bash, include = FALSE}
apt-get update
apt-get install -y parallel vim
parallel --citation
will cite
```

```{bash}
seq 5 | parallel --progress 'sleep 1' #! enter = FALSE
```

```{bash, literal = FALSE, scroll = FALSE}
Enter #! hold = 1
```

```{bash, literal = FALSE, scroll = FALSE}
#! hold = 2
```

```{bash, literal = FALSE}
#! hold = 1
```

```{bash, include = FALSE}
vim
```

```{bash}

```


```{bash}
echo Fin
```
